# LeetCode Solutions

Collection of my LeetCode solutions, focusing on **Data Structures**, **Algorithms**, and **Performance Optimization**.  
This repository tracks my journey in mastering problem-solving skills with a focus on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

## Languages & Tools
- **C++ (Primary)**
- **STL (Standard Template Library)**
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, Hashing, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Bucket Sort, etc.

## Key Features
Each solution file includes:
- **Multiple Approaches:** From brute-force to optimal solutions.
- **Complexity Analysis:** Detailed Time (`O(Time)`) and Space (`O(Space)`) complexity breakdown.
- **Trade-offs:** Pros and cons of different algorithms (e.g., Sorting vs. Hashing).

## Repository Structure
Solutions are automatically synced via [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub).

| Difficulty | Focus Area |
|------------|------------|
| **Easy** | Fundamental Logic, STL Usage |
| **Medium** | Optimization, Algorithmic Patterns |
| **Hard** | System Design, Complex DP/Graph |
